## Vue.js

Managed to work my way through the tutorial, there was a lot to get through but for the most part it was a pleasant experience. To start coding, Vue doesn't require you know JSX and TypeScript and libraries galore. All that was needed to start was my very basic knowledge of **HTML** and **CSS** and the latest or the recently introduced language to my degree **JavaScript**, yaaay. Vue utilizes a virtual DOM, Im thinking this makes the performance of an app render quicker by updating specific elements than re-rendering the whole DOM. My knowledge about DOMs and virtual DOMs is too scarce to comment further.

Maybe it's nothing new and all frameworks are simillar, Vue sports this connection between Model and view components that can be helpful for ease of updating.
To complete the _Lynda Vue.js tutorial_ a few installations are required, **node.js** and **git** this is not too difficult followed by Vue.js.
There appears to be many tutorials available, Vue is also supported by popular code editors and appears to work fine in VS code. Experiencing vue.js was nice and I am looking forward to looking into the next framework.

## Resources

Had a nose at some of the provided resources on Moodle and for the most part none of them have stuck in my memory possibly due to the Flu. The history link was very hard to read and I hope it is not relevant to my assignment, after reading through a couple of other reading resources and watching some youTube vids I thought I should complete the vue.js tutorial.
<br/>
A couple of emails from the tutor with a tonne of links that I have yet to sieve through will keep me busy for a few days this week.

## Todo list:

- [x] Install vue.js
- [x] Vue tutorial on Lynda - _finished_
- [ ] Install Express.js - _I know how, just trying to work through the resources and vue.js tut to start_
- [ ] Buff out a section in the report - assignment2
- [x] [gRPC Introduction](https://youtu.be/XRXTsQwyZSU) - youtube vid
- [x] [gRPC 4 Types of API in gRPC](<(https://youtu.be/pzxy25ho5WY)>) - youTube vid
- [x] Have a nose at some of the provided resources - Moodle
## IS THIS DIFFERENT?
