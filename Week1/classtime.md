# Course Overview

# Session 1

In class, Todd our level 7 WEB tutor had us choose our own group and put together a presentation centered on the requirements for all of our assignments for the semester.

For our presentation my main input covered assignment 2 Milestone Two and Assignment 3 Part 2. Performing this execise will hopefully help keep me focused on our tasks and the marking schedule and not become side tracked and overwhelmed with unnecessary information.

Our group "Team Middle Desk" have a shared presentation slide that I will need to refer to and read in my own time to understand what is required for the other assignments and milestones starting with assignment 2.

Assignment one is the mandatory Journal worth 10%, this should be some easy marks to attain
