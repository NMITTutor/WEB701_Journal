## Presentations
After a failed presentation from lack of preparation and chosing to spend my study time trying to get through provided resources which are coming in via email at a rapid pace that entail _hours_ of reading along with hours and _hours_ of tutorials is nothing short of cognitive overload means, no time was given to view or even thinkabout what my website is supposed to be doing.
<br></br>
On listening to my class collegues websites presentations, it would appear **all** had completed assignment 2 web report. All had a mission and knew exactly what they are trying to achieve and who their audience is their competitors and much more. The presentations provided great insight and put me on the path to discovering what is required for my dairy collective auction website.

## Web Report
So thought it best I put the resources aside and leave **login and authentication** and **express.js** for another time and get the report under way. By doing this I will have a vision for what the goal for my wesite is supposed to be. 
<br></br>
After spending a number of hours completing some of sections required in the report I now have my short and long term goals set and a sketch of what I want to achieve with this project. No framwork has been chosen but working towards that.  
We were provided with a report exemplar to go off, I have found it is a tad brief for my liking and te report did not offer satisfactory descriptions. The template used in the exemplar I have implemented into my report which was indeed a great way to begin my research.

What Buzz is thinking:

>Need to stay on track and focus on what is getting marked - all the resources that are thrown my way to view and research to find which are relevant is crazy and too many, thus has pulled me away from getting anything started towards my degree. I have no website _had_ no report started and no idea what framework I want to do furthermore, by learning all these frameworks in a short time is most certainly not long enough to fully comprehend what each have to offer. If anything it is more confusing trying to learn many frameworks in a short time. Then to choose one? Maybe another week my opinion will have changed and tasks are completed.  

## Todo list:

- [x] Presentation notes - _nothing to show_
- [ ] [Install Express.js](<(https://github.com/terlici/base-express)>) - **_this is a git repo with express_**
- [ ] login and authenticaton - _Need to make time to have a play_
- [x] Buff out a section in the report - assignment2 _covered 5 sections, there are so many_ 
- [x] Have a nose at some of the provided resources - Moodle

## Waiting on week 4
